# CodeFox Local Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains documentation generated from AI conversations during development. It serves as:

- **Development Archive**: Records design decisions, workflows, and technical discussions
- **Historical Reference**: Preserves context for future development and onboarding
- **Knowledge Base**: Documents patterns, solutions, and architectural choices

## Structure

```
docs/
├── README.md                    # This file
└── YYYY-MM-DD/                  # Date-based archives
    ├── *.md                     # Dated documentation files
    └── ...
```

## Archive Organization

Documents are organized by date to maintain chronological order:

- Each date has its own directory (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- All documents within a date archive are in English
- Files are named descriptively based on their content/topic

## Document Types

### Design Documents
Technical designs and architectural decisions made during development.

### Workflow Documentation
Processes, user flows, and system interactions.

### Migration Guides
Records of major version upgrades, refactoring, and technical migrations.

### Feature Specifications
Detailed specifications for features and capabilities.

## Best Practices

1. **Date Archives**: Place documents in date-specific folders
2. **English Only**: All documentation should be in English
3. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive file names
4. **Update Regularly**: Archive conversations promptly after significant discussions
5. **Keep Context**: Include enough context for future readers to understand decisions

## Current Archives

- `2025-10-11/` - Initial documentation archive (settings design, dev server workflow, AI SDK migration)
